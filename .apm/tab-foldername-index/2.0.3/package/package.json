It complicates the navigation.  \nThis extension fixes tab view if opened `index.*` file. Tab with `index` filename has double title (folder's name + file's name).  \nAlso it supports `__init__.py`, `__init__.php` files.  \n\n![tab with __init__.py filename](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4091305/15450136/2cca3d56-1fa5-11e6-8a19-51c84d63fd5c.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Connormiha/atom-tab-foldername-index/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Connormiha/atom-tab-foldername-index#readme","_id":"tab-foldername-index@2.0.3","_shasum":"6628111b2cb0a73ecacb6391bd6676803564e1f5","_resolved":"file:../d-117431-7177-1hfsvp8.gbq1hpk3xr/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117431-7177-1hfsvp8.gbq1hpk3xr/package.tgz"}
